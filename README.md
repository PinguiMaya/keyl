<!-- release notes -->
## Release notes
Hi!, the first **beta of KeyL** was released, this program is completely based on my python library <a href="https://pypi.org/project/txtstr/">TXTSTR</a>.  Adapting this library for a program for anyone was a challenge that I took so that without having any programming knowledge you can have your most important files safe. KeyL is free and <a href="#open-source">Open Source. </a>
<br/>

## System Requirements
OS: **Windows** <br/>
RAM: **2GB RAM (4GB preferable)**<br/>
STORAGE: **500mb**<br/>



<!-- HOW TO USE -->
<br/>

# How to use?


[![miniatura][twosteps]](https://github.com/pinguimaya/linkclips)

<br/>

In order to use **KeyL** you have to do this simple steps.<br/>
1. Create your own UNIQUE KEY
2. Choose your KEY
3. Choose your .TXT file
4. Select the number of time that the file will be processed
5. Encrypt or Decrypt

**Remember not to lose your ONLY KEY and not to forget the number of times you want it to be processed**, this number can be from 1-30 (Low: 1-10, Normal: 10-20, High: 20-30) KeyL recommends you using 14 is the default number so you just have to have your key. These keys will NEVER BE THE SAME

**With these unique keys you can encrypt more than 1000 files!** We recommend uploading your key to the cloud so you don't lose it!

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<!-- REPAIR -->
# Repair
**KeyL** has the option to repair the program when it has an error, what you do is reset the settings of `settings.txt` and that file is recreated. If this doesn't solve your problem <a href="#contact">contact the creator</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pinguimaya/keyl/issues">post your bug</a > for any user and even the creator to help you. To be able to fix this problem in a next <a href="#about-updates">update.</a>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<!-- UPDATES -->
# About updates
**KeyL** promises to release updates as soon as possible to always be on a stable schedule. I'm still working on automatic updates, for the full version beta will be one of the things that will be added so that there is no inconvenience or misinformation when an update comes out

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<!-- FREE -->
# Free
**KeyL** will never ask you to pay to encrypt your files or "premium" versions. The purpose of KeyL is to provide the tool and adapt the TXTSTR, **KeyL** apart from being 100% free is also <a href="#open-source">Open Source</a> so anyone can create their own version of the program.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


<!-- OPEN SOURCE -->
# Open Source
**KeyL is Open Source**, so anyone can create their own version of the code, the only requirement is to acknowledge the author <a href="https://pingui.tk">**Pingüi Maya**</a>, **KeyL** It is based on 100% <a href="https://pypi.org/project/txtstr/">**TXTSTR**</a> in its main libraries. Here is a short explanation of the code, which you can find in this repository:

<br/>

 The **KeyL** code is 100% python, if you want to create your own version you need to install the following libraries:

<br/>


* <a href="https://pypi.org/project/txtstr/">**TXTSTR**</a>
  ```s
  pip install txtstr
  ```
  

* **custom-tkinter**
  ```s
  pip install custom-tkinter
  ```

<br/>

The ```import txtstr``` is used to encrypt and decrypt files this library is also 100% <a href="https://github.com/PinguiMaya/txtstr">open source</a>

<br/>

The ```import custom-tkinter``` library is used, to make the following interface "modern":
